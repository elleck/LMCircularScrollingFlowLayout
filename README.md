## Usage

Just use in place of UICollectionViewFlowLayout. You can select it as the UICollectionViewFlowLayout subclass in interface builder.

Works fine with all the standard flow layout features, including multiple sections and multiple lines in a section. Works well with scrollview paging enabled or disabled. Tip: If you enable paging, enable Bounce as well.

NOTE: This layout hasn't been tested with some of the new auto-cell sizing features included with iOS 8.0 yet. If you try it out, I'd like to hear if it works or not.


To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
